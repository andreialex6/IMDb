# IMDb

Developed a Java application similar to IMDb, enabling users to add, rate, and view details about movies and actors. Implemented both terminal-based and graphical user interfaces using Swing, providing users with multiple interaction options. Accounts are presented in json files. There are more types of accounts such as Regular, Contributor, Admin, each type having different permissions. For example, as an Admin, you can remove accounts and movies from the application.
